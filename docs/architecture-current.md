# CASHNET current architecture — Phase 4

This is the implemented Phase 4 architecture. It preserves Phase 3 collection and adds bounded graph tracing over stored facts only; attribution remains deferred.

## 2. API and authorization flow

```text
request → pino request ID/log redaction → route validation
        → development actor authentication (v1 only)
        → role permission check → case-membership scoped lookup
        → service → repository transaction → response

No active/authorized actor, disabled development auth, or missing actor
  → standardized authentication/unavailable error.
Insufficient permission → 403 and audit event.
Missing or inaccessible case → 404 and denied-access audit event.
```

## 3. Database flow

                    ▼
       raw payload → normalizer → typed provider result
```

Unsupported chains and unsupported capabilities are explicit typed outcomes. Synthetic mode does not silently select a live provider.

## 5. Ethereum pipeline

```text
authorized investigation
 → EtherscanEthereumProvider
 → account balance / txlist / tokentx / txlistinternal / proxy lookups
 → EVM normalizer
 → normalized transaction, transfer, interaction and provenance
 → atomic wallet/transaction child-record persistence
 → collection audit event
```

## 6. Bitcoin pipeline

```text
authorized investigation
 → EsploraBitcoinProvider
 → address profile/history or transaction lookup
 → Bitcoin normalizer
 → txid, vin(previous outpoint), vout, fee, confirmation/block fields
 → atomic persistence of wallet, transaction, inputs and outputs
 → collection audit event
```

Bitcoin facts retain UTXO semantics; they are not flattened into an account-only model.

## 7. TRON pipeline

```text
authorized investigation
 → TronGridProvider
 → account activity / transaction / TRC-20 history
 → TRON normalizer
 → transaction and token-transfer records with provenance
 → atomic persistence and collection audit event
```

## 8. Evidence and provenance flow

```text
provider raw payload
 → provider/source/reference/retrieved-at/method/raw-reference
 → normalized fact (API source type)
 → case-scoped persistence
 → audit event

Observed blockchain fact ≠ analytical inference ≠ entity label ≠ VASP candidate ≠ real-world identity.
```

## 9. Graph tracing flow

```text
stored normalized facts → deterministic relationship extractor
                       → investigation_graph_relationships (derived)
                       → case-authorized bounded BFS → evidence-backed graph response
```

The graph service never calls external providers. It supports direction, time, exact-decimal amount and asset filters, reports limits/truncation, and keeps Bitcoin UTXO projections explicitly inferred.

## 10. Complete authorization and API architecture

```text
user request
  → request ID + redacted Pino log
  → /api legacy synthetic route, OR /api/v1 route
  → v1 development actor boundary (disabled in production)
  → permission check → non-enumerating case-membership lookup
  → investigation/case service → repository interface → PostgreSQL transaction
  → standardized result/error + append-only audit event
```

Legacy `/api/*` keeps its synthetic dashboard, cases, fund-flow, wallet, prediction, intervention, and reporting workflow. Persistent `/api/v1/*` provides health/version, cases, audit, investigations/wallet subjects/collection/graph, evidence, and authorized provider read routes. The authoritative request/response contract is `lib/api-spec/openapi.yaml`; Orval regenerates the React client and Zod runtime validators.

## 11. Graph model and safeguards

```text
canonical normalized fact
  → relationship extractor
  → derived relationship (case + chain + tx + addresses + asset + amount)
  → authorized investigation query
  → one indexed relationship read
  → bounded BFS
  → ranked paths, edges, nodes, evidence and transparent limits
```

Node identity is `CHAIN:lowercase-address`, preventing accidental cross-chain identity. Node types are address/contract only. EVM/TRON native transfers become `TRANSFER` or `CONTRACT_INTERACTION`; token transfers become `TOKEN_TRANSFER`. Bitcoin input/output pair projections become `UTXO_SPEND` with `INFERENCE` provenance and never assert common ownership or change attribution.

Defaults are depth 2, 25 neighbors/node, 250 nodes, and 500 edges. Hard ceilings are depth 5, 100 neighbors, 1,000 nodes, and 2,000 edges. Filters are applied before traversal; exact decimal strings use `BigInt` comparison. BFS tracks visited chain-qualified nodes, never scans a provider, and reports `INSUFFICIENT_DATA` when stored history is absent. Ranking is deterministic: fewer hops, complete evidence, then lexical path identity; neighbor priority is amount descending, timestamp descending, transaction hash, then relationship ID.

## 12. Security boundary

No private keys, seed phrases, signing, broadcasting, client-side provider secrets, VASP conclusions, labels, or real-world identity claims are present. Provider access requires explicit authorized data mode and server-side configuration. Pino redacts authorization, cookies, developer-actor headers, and common secret fields. Successful graph reads audit bounded execution metadata; unauthorized or inaccessible case access is audited but returned as non-enumerable not-found.
