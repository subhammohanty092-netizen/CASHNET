# CASHNET current implementation status — 2026-09-01

## Overall status

Phases 0–5 remain historical implementation/release checkpoints. Phase 6 has post-tag corrective work for migration compatibility, persistent analytics, guarded APIs, JWT verification, middleware, observability, and container/runtime configuration. Its authoritative current state is [phase6-final-production-readiness.md](phase6-final-production-readiness.md): it is conditional, not production-ready.

## Repository integration

`CASHNET` remains the root repository. The eight repositories requested by the project plan are present under `references/` for read-only architectural and data-format study: Open-Source-Blockchain-Forensics, chainforensics, am-i-exposed, evidencly-platform, crypto-wallet-address-labels, bitcoin-address-clustering, mev-wallet-cluster-analysis, and dtcch-2025-OpenAML. No source code was copied into CASHNET. In particular, the AGPL ChainForensics code was not incorporated.

## Backend pipeline

The backend now provides versioned Phase 2–5 API boundaries alongside untouched legacy synthetic `/api/*` routes. Phase 5 consumes stored facts/graph links and an explicitly approved local label source only; it surfaces freshness/conflicts, classifies service leads, and keeps cluster output review-required. It makes no person-identity claim and has no default external intelligence source.

## Working verification

The current corrective branch passes TypeScript checking, OpenAPI generation, **56 API/unit tests**, production API build, and `git diff --check`. The authorised running API returned 200 for health/version/readiness/metrics and executed controlled PostgreSQL-backed AML, graph/community and historical DeFi/MEV flows; empty inputs produced zero findings rather than fabricated intelligence. A local production-mode HTTP probe separately verified HSTS, CSP, request IDs, CORS allowlisting, safe metrics, and fail-closed readiness without a database configuration.

## Environment status

The operator's authorised PowerShell session completed the real PostgreSQL validator against `cashnet`: first migration pass, idempotent second pass, complete Phase 0–6 ledger, Phase 6 tables/indexes/constraints/foreign keys, immutable-audit trigger, and real audit `UPDATE`/`DELETE` rejection all passed. This Codex process still does not inherit the secret-bearing connection string, so it does not repeat that command or print the value. Provider credentials/endpoints, Docker CLI/daemon, an approved label dataset, and an independent held-out ground-truth corpus were not supplied to this process; those gates remain precisely classified rather than claimed as passed.

## Next action

Run the guarded non-empty analytical validation from the already authorised PowerShell session: `pwsh -File .\scripts\validate-phase6-nonempty.ps1 -ConfirmCreateValidationFixture`. It creates a separately numbered, explicitly marked validation fixture and exercises privileged reporting plus persisted AML, graph, community and historical DeFi/MEV output. Then run the isolated backup/restore drill and any legitimately configured provider collection flows.
